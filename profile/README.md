## ðŸŒ€ Gozjaro Linux
Gozjaro Linux is a new, elegant, and minimalistic Linux distribution built for power users, developers, and curious explorers who crave full control over their system. Inspired by the simplicity and flexibility of Arch Linux, Gozjaro takes a bold step furtherâ€”starting from the bare metal with Linux From Scratch (LFS), yet empowered by the strength and speed of the Pacman package manager.

Gozjaro isnâ€™t just a distroâ€”it's a foundation. A terminal-based, clean-slate operating system that puts you in charge from the first boot. No pre-installed desktop environments. No bloat. Just the core essentials and a wide-open path to build exactly what you wantâ€”whether thatâ€™s a lightweight developer workstation, a custom server, or a polished desktop environment of your choosing.

But Gozjaro isnâ€™t only about individual customizationâ€”it's about community. We aim to grow an open and inclusive ecosystem where users and developers collaborate, experiment, and innovate together. We welcome contributions, ideas, and discussions that push boundaries and build something truly unique.

Though still in its early conceptual stage, Gozjaro Linux carries a vision:
To inspire curiosity, empower creation, and foster confidence through simplicity and transparency.
