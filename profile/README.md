# 🌀 Gozjaro Linux

Welcome to the **official GitHub organization of Gozjaro Linux** — a minimalist, elegant, and fully customizable Linux distribution built from scratch, powered by [Pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman).

Gozjaro is not just a distro. It's a **blank canvas** for developers, power users, and curious minds who want to build their systems from the ground up — with full control, high performance, and no unnecessary bloat.
